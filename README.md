# Microsoft SQL Server 

Hello, I've uploaded the codes that I wrote for my Database Management Systems class. 

During the course, we covered the following topics:

* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
* JOINS
* Subqueries
* Views
* Triggers
* Stored Procedures

using MSSQL.

## File Description
*  .doc files contain tasks provided by the instructor. 
*  .sql files contain the SQL code solutions.

If you prefer, you can try to solve them on your own. If you encounter any difficulties, you can refer to my codes.

**Note:** The tasks are not in English, so you will need to translate them.
